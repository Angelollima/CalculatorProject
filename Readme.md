## Model of a calculator built with Python!

### What does each thing mean

* `import os` to clean the terminal
* `import math sqrt` to do the square root
* `from operator import add, sub, mul, pow` taking only the `add`, `sub`, `mul`, `pow` methods from the operator library
-> add = addition;
-> sub = subtraction;
-> mul = multiplication;
-> pow = exponentiation.

* BOLD_TEXT = formatting the text in bold and going 60 to the right.

* OPTIONS = Calculation options (Self explanatory)

* Operations is a dictionary where you have the keys (our "options"), each value is the representation of how the calculation should happen (calling the `operators` and functions `lambda`)
